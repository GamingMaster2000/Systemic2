Console crash information
=========================
The Console appears to have crashed. The terminal shows you two options:

- Click on the RESTORE.CRASH link to attempt to restore your work;
- Click on the menu item "Edit -> Kill and restart session" to just close the session and restart from scratch.

What happened?
==============
Crashes in the Console package are usually originated within the C code. They might be due to unexpected inputs (either from you, or from the R code) that were not corrected before they were sent to the C code, or an actual programming error. When those crashes happen, the process that executes the code panics and exits.

Reporting issues
================
Click on Help -> Reporting a bug for instructions on filing a bug.
