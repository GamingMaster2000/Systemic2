QUICKSTART
==========
You can use Systemic by typing commands in the terminal (this area), or by using the user interface (menus and buttons). For a tour of the interface, use Help -> Tutorial.

User interface
==============
- Each fit is called a "kernel", an object which carries both data (e.g. radial velocity) and parameters (e.g. orbital parameters, velocity offsets, etc.). A list of kernels is on the left hand side panel (KERNELS); the properties of the selected kernel are displayed in the PARAMETERS panel.

- You can open/save kernels using File -> Open... and File -> Save...
- Add data to a fit using the Data Browser panel (star icon).
- Add new planets by clicking on the Planet buttons.
- To optimize a fit, use the Optimize button.
- To select parameters to optimize over, use the "semaphore" circle buttons next to each parameter.

Explore the menus to get an idea of the type of tasks that can be run through Systemic.

Terminal
========
The terminal accepts R commands. See Help -> R tutorial for a quick tutorial on the R language.
