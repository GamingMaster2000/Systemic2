========================
- New default color scheme. Color schemes can be switched (under the Options menu)
- New menu items in periodogram plots
- Lifted limitation on the number of planets. Performance in the user interface decreases noticeably past ~15 planets (because of data being shuttled back and forth between the core and the GUI). This will be addressed in a future update.
