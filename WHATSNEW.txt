2.1700 [June 13th, 2014]
========================
- NEW: ktable function for showing the fit values as a table, suitable for exporting to TeX or HTML
- FIXED: bug in simplex that would crash the application if the minimizer encountered a NaN value.
- FIXED: bug in the GUI that would crash the application in case of excessive text output.
- Fixed naming of columns in the matrix returned by kdata().
- FIXED: bug where the radial velocity curve or periodogram would look excessively jagged.
- FIXED: bug in kperiodogram.boot where the function could crash.
- FIXED: bug in kperiodogram.boot where the function would only calculate the 'full' periodogram (instead of the periodogram of residuals)
- FIXED: bug in the GUI periodogram routine, where you could receive an error for certain power spectra.
- FIXED: Kernel plot using plot() respects the chosen xlim.
- FIXED: MCMC would crash in certain situations when set up from the menu.
- FIXED: 1LO-crossval returns the signed sum of logs, instead of the absolute value.

2.1600 [March 6th, 2014]
========================
- New default color scheme. Color schemes can be switched (under the Options menu)
- New menu items in periodogram plots
- Lifted limitation on the number of planets. Performance in the user interface decreases noticeably past ~15 planets (because of data being shuttled back and forth between the core and the GUI). This will be addressed in a future update.

2.1500
======
- FIXED: bug for users that had locale settings using "," (or another character) as their decimal separator. The dot character is now used consistently throughout the interface. (credit for reporting: Brice-Olivier Demory)

2.1400
======
- Added a feature for smoother/faster plotting in GUI
- Periodograms now print out the strongest peaks
- Periodograms are zoomable
- Fixed Cross-validation for fits with only one planet
- New menu item to add random Gaussian noise to data
- Smooth orbits plot from an error estimation object

2.1300
======
- FIXED: Improved Linux installation instructions (credit for reporting: Thomas Kosvic)
- FIXED: bug in SWIFTRMVS on 32-bit installations (credit for reporting: Thomas Kosvic)

2.1200
======
- Fixed bug where R would crash if integration were stopped from the GUI
- Added a new sample R script in sample/

2.1100
======
- R does not hang when the user inputs a command where symbols are not balanced (e.g. a bracket or a quote that is not closed)
- Systemic can now send interrupt signals to R and attempt to escape loops
- Systemic can complete functions at the prompt
- Increased smoothness of curves

2.1010
======
- Changed name of "local" directory to "deps" directory

2.1000
======
- Restored proper antialiasing in the rendering of curves and points in plots
- Added a new "Data" menu to manipulate datasets
